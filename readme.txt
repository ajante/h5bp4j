H5BP4J
======
H5BP4J is a basic Joomla responsive template, based on excellent [HTML5 Boilerplate 3.0](http://html5boilerplate.com), and should be treated as a starting point for someone who knows CSS, HTML and a little bit of PHP and wants to create his own template.

It was written for Joomla! 2.5. Now Joomla! 3.0 comes with own responsive template.

Layout
------
Template layout is based on horizontal header (with topmenu), content area (with breadcrumbs, left, main and right columns), bottom and footer, and is using `<div id="header">` rather than `<header>` tags.

For compatibility with the default Joomla template (Beez) modules named "position-xx" are included, e.g.:
<div id="left">
	<jdoc:include type="modules" name="left" style="xhtml"/>
	<jdoc:include type="modules" name="position-4" style="xhtml"/>
	<jdoc:include type="modules" name="position-7" style="xhtml"/>
	<jdoc:include type="modules" name="position-5" style="xhtml"/>
</div>
